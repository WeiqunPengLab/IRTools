# IRTools
IRTools is a computational toolset for detection and analysis of intron retention from RNA-Seq libraries.

## Installation



#### PIP

To install directly from PyPI:

```
pip install IRTools
```

If this fails, please install all dependencies first:

```
pip install HTSeq
pip install pysam
pip install pandas
pip install networkx
pip install bx-python==0.7.3
```


#### From source

To install from source:

1\. Install the dependencies with your favorite tools (`pip`, `conda`, etc.).

2\. Run:

```
python setup.py install
```


## Usage

```
IRTools [-h] [-v] {annotation,quant,diff} ...
```

There are three major functions available in IRTools serving as sub-commands.

| Command | Function |
| --- | --- |
| annotation | Generate annotation GTF file for intron retention analysis. |
| quant | Quantify intron retention in both gene and intron levels. |
| diff | Detection of differential intron retention from two samples with replicates in both gene and intron levels. |


### annotation

#### Arguments
**-g/--GTF-file GTFFILE**

Input annotation [GTF](http://mblab.wustl.edu/GTF22.html) File. GTF file for a specific species can be downloaded from [iGenome](https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html).

**-o/--annotation-file ANNOFILE**

Output annotation GTF file.

**--outdir**

If specified, all output files will be written to that directory. Default: the current working directory.

#### Output

ANNOFILE is a GTF file that contains information for intron retention analysis. i.e., the genomic coordinates of introns, exon-intron junctions, etc.
